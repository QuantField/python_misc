The Cardiff Central MP also said a lack of "guarantees for the people of Wales" contributed to her decision to defy her party leadership.
Cardiff voted to remain in the EU during the 2016 referendum, and remains a target of the pro-EU Liberal Democrats.
Jeremy Corbyn responded to Ms Stevens's resignation saying: "I understand the difficulties that Jo, and other MPs, have when facing the Article 50 Bill. Those MPs with strong Remain constituencies are understandably torn."
He continued: "We have said all along that Labour will not frustrate the triggering of Article 50 and to that end we are asking all MPs to vote for the Bill at its second reading next week."
Two Labour whips - MPs in charge of parliamentary party discipline - have said they will vote against the EU (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill, despite the order to support it.
Jeff Smith and Thangam Debbonaire have said they will vote against it although neither have resigned their posts as party whips.
Another shadow minister Daniel Zeichner has also said he will vote against the bill, as will other MPs including former Culture Secretary Ben Bradshaw.
